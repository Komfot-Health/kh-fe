      <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>

      <h2>Why We Use Cookies</h2>
      <p>
       We use cookies on our website to understand more about our users and to
       improve their experience across our website. The purposes for which they
       are used include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>Recognise a computer when a user visits the website</li>
       <li>Track users as they navigate the website</li>
       <li>Improve the website’s usability</li>
       <li>Analyse the use of the website</li>

       <li>Improve the security of the website</li>
       <li>Personalise the website for our users</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
       A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and
       numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by
       the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the
       browser requests a page from the server.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cookies may be either “persistent” or “session” cookies. A persistent
       cookie will be stored by a web browser and remain valid until its set
       expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date. A session
       cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session,
       when the web browser is closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally
       identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may
       be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they
       navigate different pages on a website and identify users returning to a
       website.
